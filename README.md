###  I'm taking a break from hosting the blog.  

All posts created so far are kept private.  
I felt uncomfortable with a huge flood of development information.   
Time given to everyone is the same, but I think the reason why we received various evaluations is because of the originality of the experience.  
I might not be able to write good things at once, but I think I need a process of self-realizing the value of my experience first to have a good influence on someone.  
I plan to reopen my blog when I have contents to share.
I would appreciate it if you all look forward when I see you with good posts.
